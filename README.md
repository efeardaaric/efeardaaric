### Hi, I'm Efe Arda Arıç 👋  
**Mobile Developer** | **ML Enthusiast** | **Indie Game Hobbyist**

I build mobile apps with a focus on clean design and smooth user experience.  
Lately, I've been diving into **machine learning**, exploring how data and code come together.

On the side, I like to experiment with mobile game development —  
and yes, I enjoy hiding a few easter eggs here and there.

> 🎮 Favorite game: **Elden Ring**
